								<b>Introduction—</b> Mohanad Alkhodari is a DPhil. student in Medical Sciences (Cardiovascular Enineering) at the Cardiovascular Clinical Research Facility (CCRF), Radcliffe Department of Medicine (RDM), University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom (UK). He is also a biomedical engineering research associate (RA) at the Healthcare Engineering Innovation Centre (HEIC), Department of Biomedical Engineering, Khalifa University (KU), United Arab Emirates (UAE). He has led the establishment of the first-ever Oxford-Khalifa studentship for outstanding academics and researchers, and he was the first recipient of this award to cover all tuition fees and living expenses during the 3-year course of study at Oxford.
								<b>Education/scholarships—</b> Alkhodari received his Master of Science (M.S.) degree (top 5-10%) in Biomedical Engineering (medical imaging) from American University of Sharjah (AUS), UAE and his Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree (Hons.) in Electrical Engineering (biosignals and bioimaging) from Abu Dhabi University (ADU), UAE in 2019 and 2017, respectively. While pursuing his graduate M.S. degree at AUS, Alkhodari worked as a graduate teaching and research assistant (GTA/GRA) at the College of Engineering, where he was awarded a full (100%) scholarship from the Bioengineering and Biosciences Research Institute (BBRI) at the university for his academic excellence in the undergraduate studies. He was a representative of the electrical and biomedical engineering graduate programs for the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) students’ chapter at AUS. Furthermore, he was awarded a partial scholarship (50%) to pursue the undergraduate B.S. degree at ADU.
								<b>Work experience—</b> Alongside his main full-time research position at KU, Alkhodari held part-time research appointments for 3+ years at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of AUS and at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of ADU. Alkhodari had a practical training in biomedical engineering at Specialized Rehabilitation Hospital and Health Shield Medical Centre of Capital Health, Abu Dhabi, UAE while pursuing his M.S. degree and a research internship at the Institute Centre for Microsystems (iMicro) at KU during his undergraduate studies.
							    </b>Research interests—</b> Alkhodari research focuses on developing artificial intelligence tools to leverage personalised healthcare in clinical practice, mostly for cardiovascular diseases assessment. His current research interests include machine/deep learning, biosignals and bioimaging, and healthcare informatics.

								</b>Publications—</b> By far, he authored and co-authored 3 book chapters and more than 40 scientific papers in international journals and conferences, where he was the first/leading author in majority of them. He has one US/UAE patent currently under-review on developing a stand-alone app for heart failure assessment using deep learning and novel multiparameter polar images.
								<b>Extracurricular—</b> Besides his regular supervision and assistance to fresh and junior biomedical engineering researchers at KU, Alkhodari supervised 2 PhD. students in dissertation-related research, 1 M.S. student in thesis project, 6 M.S. groups in course project activities, and 2 B.S. group on their Senior Design Project (SDP). He worked closely alongside Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers at international universities in Greece and Japan in collaborative research projects. In addition, he spared some time to serve as an active reviewer for several papers in Frontiers in (Physiology, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and Signal Processing), IEEE Access, and BMC BioMedical Engineering OnLine journals. 
								<b>Awards—</b> He was awarded the 4th place at the international PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2022. Alkhodari was awarded the 1st place at the regional 2017 Undergraduate Research Competition (URC) for GCC countries held at ADU with his B.S. graduation SDP of a smartphone application for early detection of diabetes, the 1st place at the national 2019 UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP) innovations in health hackathon with a group design of a smart wearable cap for epileptic patients, and the 3rd place at the national 2017 Think Science Fair with the B.S. graduation SDP.
								<b>Others—</b> Alkhodari spends his free time doing gym workouts. He enjoys graphic designing and taking care of his two little bunnies.
